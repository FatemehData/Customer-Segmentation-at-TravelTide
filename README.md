# TravelTide Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Project Overview
TravelTide's Rewards Program aims to enhance customer engagement and loyalty through tailored rewards and perks. This project involves analyzing customer behavior and preferences to segment customers into distinct clusters based on their affinity for specific perks within the program.

## Main Steps
1. **Data Collection:** Using SQL queries to gather customer data including behavioral metrics and demographic information.
2. **Index Calculation:** Calculating various indexes like Hotel Hunter Index, Average Bags Index, Cancellation Rate, Bargain Hunter Index, Combined Booking Index, and Session Intensity Index for each customer.
3. **Ranking Customers:** Using Python to rank customers based on their index values in descending order.
4. **Defining Perks:** Assigning the most attractive perk to each customer based on their rank in the indexes and segmenting customers into groups based on their preferred perks.
5. **Demographic Analysis:** Analyzing customer segments by demographic characteristics (age, gender, marital status, parental status) using Tableau.
6. **Visualization:** Creating Tableau visualizations to present findings and insights.

## Key Findings
- **Behavior-Based Segmentation:** Customers segmented into five clusters based on preferences for specific perks.
- **Cluster Interests:** 
  - Cluster 0: Interested in 'No Cancellation Fees' and 'Exclusive Discounts'.
  - Cluster 1: Prefers flight discounts and accompanying services.
  - Cluster 2: Strong interest in hotel and flight discounts.
  - Cluster 3: Keen interest in hunting for discounts.
  - Cluster 4: Prefers perks related to combined bookings.

## Recommendations
